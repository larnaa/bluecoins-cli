Cluecoins is a tool to manage the database of [Bluecoins](https://www.bluecoinsapp.com/) via ClI or TUI. That is currently unstable. Use at your own risk, and always have a database backup!

</br>

Available two types of interfaces:

- **CLI** - the terminal interface;
- **TUI** - the graphic interface  
    TUI works only with **Android** and **rooted** devices. Cluecoins need **root** for access to the directory with `bluecoins.fydb` file - the current database used by Bluecoins.

</br>

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/larnaa/cluecoins.git`
2. Go to the directory `cd cluecoins`
3. Install `pip install -e .`

## Usage

1. Connect the device and give the PC access to it.
2. Run Cluecoins TUI `cluecoins tui` or CLI `cluecoins cli`.

### Development mode

> Installing Hatch would help you manage the development environment more easily.

To run an entire development environment, use `hatch shell`. To run an entire CI pipeline and start linters and tests, use `hatch run dev:all`.

## Commands CLI

- `convert` - update transactions currency with data from [Exchangerate](https://api.exchangerate.host/timeseries);  
  
- `archive` - archive account, including all transactions  
  (not stable, will soon be rewritten [#55](https://github.com/larnaa/cluecoins/issues/55) - move account and transactions to Cluecoins tables);  

- `unarchive` - unarchive account.

**In development:**

- `add-label` - add the label to all transactions of the one account;  

- `create-account` - create a new account.

## Manual database backup/restore (CLI)

1. Open the Bluecoins app. Go to *Settings -> Data Management -> Phone Storage -> Backup to phone storage*.
2. Transfer created `*.fydb` database backup file to the PC.
3. After performing operations on that file transfer it to the smartphone. Go to *Settings -> Data Management -> Phone Storage -> Restore from phone storage*. Choose created file.

## Backups

Cluecoins automatically creates a backup file `backup_{namedb}.fydb` when starting.
